        <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
        <p>Former engineering student, who simply switched to IT for various reasons.</p>
        <p>My preferred field is anything related to making/crafting, and especially machining.<br>
            However, I discovered that when you study the things you like the most, you might get to slowly start
            disliking your favorite topics.<br>
            Which is exacly what happened in engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hence switched to a field which attracts me quite as much as mechanics did, and here I am, making my own
            website !
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently studying IT, but still have a lot of my projects going on.<br>
            You will find most of those projects under the "My work" menu.<br>
            I separated the mechanics, IT, and others topics for more clarity.
        </p>
